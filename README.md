# From scanning to vector

1. When scanning use white background and press on the lid to remove shadows.
1. To convert from image to vector use imagemagick in Linux: `for PHOTO in LEGO/*; do BASE=`basename $PHOTO`; echo "Converting $PHOTO"; convert "$PHOTO" -fuzz 30% -transparent white "LEGO-vector/$BASE.svg"; done`
